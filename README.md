This is a simple Python script that uses the scipy.optimize library to find the optimal sales price for a product given historical sales data. The script prompts the user to input the sales data for two different prices, calculates the angular coefficient of the sales line, and defines a function to minimize the negative revenue. The optimization is performed using the minimize function from scipy.optimize, which finds the maximum of the revenue function. Finally, the script outputs the optimal price, expected sales, and expected revenue. 

This code is designed to help businesses maximize revenue by finding the best price point and associated sales level for a product. The code takes in two sets of historical data - prices and sales - and calculates the angular coefficient of a line that fits the data. This angular coefficient represents the rate of change in revenue for each additional unit of sales.

Using this angular coefficient, the code defines a function that takes in a sales level and returns the revenue generated at that level, based on the equation of the line. The minimize function from the scipy.optimize library is then used to find the maximum value of the negative of this function, which corresponds to the maximum revenue.

Once the optimal sales level is found, the code uses the angular coefficient of the line to determine the optimal price point that corresponds to that sales level. The code then outputs the optimal price, optimal sales level, and expected revenue based on these calculations.

In summary, this code provides a mathematical approach to finding the optimal price and sales level for a product, based on historical data, that will result in the highest revenue.

#Acknowledgments
  
This project was inspired by the need to optimize the sales price for a product based on historical sales data. The scipy.optimize library made it easy to find the maximum of a revenue function and obtain the optimal sales price.
